            Travel and accomodations

          <p>Will there be some kind of organized transfer?
            No, we'll just meet at the church at 13:15.</p>

            <p>Where can I park?
            Parking is free on the weekends in the 1st district. The locations are close to each other so you won't need
            your
            car.</p>

            <p>How can I get home at night?
            The 916 bus is in service all night at the castle and it hits every major traffic hub in the city.</p>
